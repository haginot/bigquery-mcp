# BigQuery MCP Server Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the BigQuery MCP server according to the specification in spec.md.

## Implementation Details

- **MCP Specification**: Implements MCP specification rev 2025-03-26
- **Transport**: Supports both stdio (default) and HTTP transports
- **BigQuery Integration**: Uses Google Cloud BigQuery Python client library
- **Authentication**: Uses Google Cloud service account authentication
- **Docker Support**: Containerized for easy deployment

## Key Features

1. **BigQuery Operations**:
   - Execute SQL queries
   - Get job status
   - Cancel jobs
   - Fetch results with pagination
   - List datasets
   - Get table schemas

2. **MCP Protocol Compliance**:
   - Implements initialize, tools/list, and call_tool methods
   - Supports proper error handling according to JSON-RPC 2.0
   - Implements logging capabilities

3. **Resource Exposure** (Optional):
   - Exposes BigQuery schemas as resources
   - Exposes query results as resources

## Fixed Issues

### Stdio Transport in Docker

Fixed the issue where the Docker container would exit prematurely after receiving the initialize message from Claude Desktop. The solution:

1. Run the stdio_server function in a separate thread
2. Keep the main thread alive with a loop
3. Ensure proper handling of the initialize → listTools → callTool sequence

### BigQuery Connection

Implemented proper async-based handlers for BigQuery operations to ensure efficient execution of queries and retrieval of results.

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with:

1. **HTTP Transport**: Verified with test_docker_connection.py
2. **Stdio Transport**: Verified with test_scripts/test_claude_init_sequence.py
3. **BigQuery Connection**: Verified with test_scripts/test_bigquery_connection.py
4. **Claude Desktop Simulation**: Verified the exact sequence of requests that Claude Desktop sends

## Docker Usage

The Docker container can be run in two modes:

1. **HTTP Transport**:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8000:8000 --rm \
     -v /path/to/credentials:/credentials \
     -e GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/credentials/service-account-key.json \
     mcp-bigquery-server --http --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

2. **Stdio Transport** (for Claude Desktop):
   ```bash
   docker run -i --rm \
     -v /path/to/credentials:/credentials \
     -e GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/credentials/service-account-key.json \
     mcp-bigquery-server --stdio
   ```

## Conclusion

The BigQuery MCP server implementation successfully meets all the requirements specified in spec.md and addresses the specific issues with stdio transport in Docker containers. It provides a robust and efficient interface to BigQuery operations through the Model Context Protocol.
